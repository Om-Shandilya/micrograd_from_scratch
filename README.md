## Original Project Summary

This project involved building a lightweight, scalar autograd engine in Python from scratch to understand the mechanics of backpropagation. It includes the implementation of the computational graph and the backward pass for a full Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), demonstrating a fundamental, code-level understanding of how neural networks learn.
